# Python-Mean
A simple app to calculate the mean from a list of values.
Built using pandas DataFrames and the statistics library

**NOTE**: Is highly recommended to open it using Jupyter if you want to take a look to the code or something, if you just want to use it, 
then use the terminal or whatever you want.

## Future plans
For future versions, i would like to introduce features like:
  - Being able to add more subjects
  - Calculate the individual mean of each subject and the global mean
  
**NOTE 2**: Pull requests are admitted.
